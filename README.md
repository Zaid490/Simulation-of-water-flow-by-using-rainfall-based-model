# Simulation-of-water-flow-by-using-rainfall-based-model

Summary:
To investigate watershed responses to various rainfall events, a framework for a synthetic rainfall-runoff database was built. Simple procedures are used in the framework to help with successful flood risk assessment and management. Rainfall generators, continuous rainfall runoff models, and database management systems are all included. In the lower Yarmouk River basin, the system was tested in two gauged river sections (Jordan). One of the key concerns was determining whether or not basic procedures could still provide high-quality outcomes. It was decided to simulate runoff by using a rainfall-runoff model that included a high number of rainfall episodes. Pre-simulated events are stored in the rainfall runoff database according to the quantity of rainfall, starting moisture conditions, and initial discharge. This analogue technique doesn't need any fresh model simulations for the real-time operational prediction. The predictions, on the other hand, are based on data from the rainfall-runoff database's simulations (for the specific class to which the forecast belongs). Consequently, the database may be a useful tool for estimating future streamflow situations based on a variety of rainfall amounts. The database's application to the research location confirms that the magnitudes of genuine flood occurrences were accurately documented. 

The following files are distributed:

1) MATLAB codes
1.1) "model.m": model code
1.2) "model _calibration.m": code for model calibration 

2) Secondary file:
2.1) "fixed_par.txt": contains
     a) the area of the basin (km^2)
     b) the computational time step (for flood event simulation), 0.2 is OK
2.2) "IUH.txt": contains the coordinates of the dimensionless IUH (Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph)
2.3) "X_opt_ model.txt": parameter values of model     
     W_p       = PAR(1); % initial conditions, fraction of W_max (0-1)
     W_max     = PAR(2); % Field capacity
     m2        = PAR(3); % exponent of drainage
     Ks        = PAR(4); % Ks parameter of infiltration and drainage
     Nu        = PAR(5); % fraction of drainage versus interflow

3) INPUT file :
3.1) "section.txt": example file for section (64 km^2)
     It contains 4 columns
     a) date (in numeric Matlab format)
     b) rainfall depth (in mm)
     c) air temperature (Â°C)
     d) observed discharge data (m^3/s)

4) OUTPUT file:

To run the model for your own catchment the following steps have to be done:
1) creation of input file, e.g. "section.txt" and change the basin area in the "fixed_par.txt" file
2) model calibration with " model _calibration.m"
4) Run of the model with " model.m"

% ... few lines to run the model
name='section';                         % name of the input file
model _calibration.m (name)                        % model calibration
model (name,load('X_opt_ model.txt'),1)   % RUN model
